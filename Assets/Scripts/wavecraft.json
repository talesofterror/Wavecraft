Save the position of the camera before debug was toggled on so that the camera returns to that position when Debug is toggled back off. Create variables for points in the z axis that correspond to the player/enemy coord and coords needed to compensate for FOV. Create a mechanism for creating transform points for cinematic viewpoints, and set up scene gizmos for that. Create a mechanism for creating teleportation points which both the camera and player can be moved to a specific location for easy iteration"
